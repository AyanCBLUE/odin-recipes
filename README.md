This is my first Project for The Odin Project

    In this project I will be building a basic recipe website using HTML, by the end of this I would have learned :-
        - writting semantic HTML 
        - Inserting links to my website
        - how to push my project on git hub
        - how to commit properly 
        - and aslo gain a little bit of confidence
